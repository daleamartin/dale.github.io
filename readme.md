## Code Description**
 This code prints a single-apge static website portfolio of a graduating Computer Science student applying for a Frontend Software Engineer position at Gugil Co. The portfolio includes an autobiography about yourself, a featured photo, details of your skills related to management and web programming, and information about your previous projects

## Things you did in the code
First, I recalled all HTML and CSS code syntax in order for me to execute the changes that I want in my portfolio.

## Challenges encountered
One of the challenges I encountered was properly organizing my code in VScode because I was not used to programming in HTML/CSS. Another challenge I encountered was the process by which <div> is used in the text.

## Commit Log
